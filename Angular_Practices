===================
1) Two Way Data Binding:- In Angular, two-way data binding allows synchronization between the model (data) and the view (UI), 
                          meaning any changes in the UI are immediately reflected in the component class (model), and vice versa. 
                          This is achieved using Angular's [(ngModel)] directive, which is a combination of property binding ([ ]) and event binding (( )). 

2) Components:- A component is one of the core building blocks of an Angular application.
                Used to define a specific UI element and its behavior. Each component in Angular consists of four main parts: 
               1) The TypeScript class, 
               2) The HTML template, 
               3) The CSS styles,
               4) The metadata that ties these pieces together.

    Structure of an Angular Component:- 
               1) TypeScript Class: Contains the business logic and data for the component.
               2) HTML Template: Defines the layout and content of the component.
               3) CSS Styles: Includes styles that are scoped to the component.
               4) Decorator Metadata: Specifies the component’s selector, template, and style locations.


Data binding in Angular is a powerful feature that connects the component's logic (TypeScript code) with the UI (HTML template).
It enables automatic synchronization of data between the model (component) and the view (template) to create dynamic and interactive applications.
Angular offers four main types of data binding:

1) Interpolation (One-Way Binding)
Syntax:    {{ variableName }}
Description: Displays data from the component directly in the HTML.
             It’s read-only, meaning it only flows data from the component to the view.


2) Property Binding (One-Way Binding)
Syntax: [property]="expression"
Description: Binds data from the component to an element's property (like src for an image, disabled for a button, etc.). 
             It updates the property when the component data changes but doesn’t reflect changes from the DOM back to the component.


3) Event Binding
Syntax: (event)="expression"
Description: Captures and responds to user events such as clicks, key presses, mouse movements, etc.,
             and updates the component or performs actions when the event is triggered.

4) Two-Way Data Binding
Syntax: [(ngModel)]="variable"
Description: Synchronizes data in both directions, meaning that changes in the view update the component and changes in the component update the view.
             It’s commonly used with form inputs.

Learning Key_Points:-
            One-Way Binding: Interpolation and property binding flow data from the component to the view, while event binding lets the view affect the component.
            Two-Way Binding: Allows synchronized updates in both directions, ideal for dynamic forms and interactive data-driven interfaces.
